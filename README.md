- Run `npm run start` to start `http-server` on `http://localhost:3000`
    When you run server the command line window will no longer be available for
    writing commands until you stop server (`ctrl + c`). All other commands you

## Deploy on gh-pages

  ```bash
  $ npm run build
  ```

  ```bash
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -m 'commit message'
  $ git push origin master
  ```
- Execute `npm run deploy`. This command will push the `/build` folder to branch
  `gh-pages` in your remote repository.
- Add links to your demo in readme.md.
  - `[DEMO LINK](https://<your_account>.github.io/<repo_name>/)` - this will be a
  link to your index.html
