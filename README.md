# React counter

> Here is [the working version](https://mate-academy.github.io/react_counter/)

You are given the `App` component with a title with a text `Count is 0` by default and three buttons.
The buttons should work the next way:

- `Add 1` button calls `addOne` method to add `1` to the `count`;
- `Add 100` button calls `add100` method to add `100` to the `count`;
- `Increase` button calls `addOne` and then, if count was divisible by 5, it additionally calls `add100`.

So the third button should count like this:
`101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 311 ...`
